Commit: Stable header baseline (PreProject only)

Description:
This baseline captures the first fully functional modular window implementation in METRA.
The PreProject module now opens in its own independent window with:
• A unified blue header bar containing “Return to Summary” and “Close Window”
• Full task list restored with persistence via localStorage
• All colour-coded statuses and checklist styling from earlier baselines intact
• Correct storage key alignment (“preproject-tasks”) maintaining historical data
• Integration with new windowTracker.js and ModuleHeader.jsx components

The Summary Dashboard remains the central control hub, while this baseline demonstrates
the new multi-window structure that will later extend to Progress, Personnel, and Closure.

Stability:
• Verified launch via Safari (npm run dev)
• Header visible and functional
• Checklist data loads and persists correctly
• Safe restore point for all future module-window development
